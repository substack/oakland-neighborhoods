# oakland-neighborhoods

Oakland neighborhoods are
[nebulous and fuzzy](http://oaklandwiki.org/Neighborhoods).

Most neighborhood maps of Oakland are based on
[Green Streets](http://oaklandwiki.org/Greenstreets), an obscure tree planning
report from the 1970s.

This repository uses
[Gene Anderson's map](http://blog.ouroakland.net/2010/02/oakland-neighborhoods-map.html),
which uses Green Streets as a starting point and modifies the names and
boundaries to more closely align with what people who live in Oakland actually
call their neighborhoods.

The geojson in this repository was generating using the kml file at
[http://www.designsinlight.com/oakland/neighborhoods.kml](http://www.designsinlight.com/oakland/neighborhoods.kml)
as input using [togeojson](https://npmjs.org/package/togeojson).
